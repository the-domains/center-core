description: 'Sunday night brings the 89th Academy Awards, and many are wondering what film will take home the Oscar for Best Picture. No matter what film wins, one group of people should be thanked during the acceptance speech-taxpayers. Film is a heavily subsidized industry, and the majority of states have tax incentive programs that lower the cost of production.'
